# Coding platforms

### Codeforces

This is like CodeJam

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int,input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] = ((a[i]%n)+i)%n
    if(len(set(a)) == n):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```



### Leetcode
Pretty intuitive. Very regular contest. Problems are sufficiently novel every time. I want the T-shirt.



### Google Coding platforms

This refers to the [Kickstart ](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart)and [Codejam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) environments. This may be applicable to other platform. You do not need this for Leetcode and their IDE is too good.



You need to be able to hedge that your solution works. This may not be known in advance.

Interactive problems might be easier to compensate on its difficulty of implementation. Many interactive problems have a low bound on the number of moves that can be made, and you can experiment with that to formulate a strategy.

The size limits hints the allowed computation time. Sometimes it may fool you, as the optimal computation time is much lower compared.



Python 3 environment (but for some reason I need to install packages)

```
str_in = input()

def solve(w,h,l,u,r,d):
    # w,h destination
    #   l r  hole
    # u ###
    #   ###
    # d ### 

    res = 0
    # 6,4,1,3,3,4
    if u-2 >= 0 and w > r:
        # binom.cdf(1, 4, 0.5) # 1 = u-2 = 3-2, 4 = r+u-2 = 3+3-2
        res += binom.cdf(u-2, r+u-2, 0.5)
    if l-2 >= 0 and h > d:
        res += binom.cdf(l-2, d+l-2, 0.5)
    
    return res

for case in range(int(str_in)):
    strr = input()
    w,h,l,u,r,d = [int(x) for x in strr.split()]
    prob = solve(w,h,l,u,r,d)
    
    print("Case #{}: {}".format(case + 1, prob))


```



Libraries allowed in Google coding environment, other than native libraries - Numpy and scipy is [allowed](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/faq)

```
python 3.5.3 (package: python3.5)
 numpy 1.16.2 (pip install numpy)
 scipy 1.2.1 (pip install scipy)
 python3.5 Solution.py
```



To run with an input file

```
python3 a.py < a.in
```



## Reading variables

Try this

```python
T, B = map(int, input().split())
```





## Printing

The output is read from std out. How can we avoid the process of commenting and uncommmenting the code? Please refer to printing standard error





## Interactive problems

You need to obtain `interactive_runner.py` which applies to all CodeJam problem post-2020, and `local_testing_tool.py` from the specific problem. Refer to [template.md](template/template.md) for the code to run.

Run this on your computer to ensure that it is working.

```bash
for TEST_CASE in 0 1 2
do
  python interactive_runner.py python3 sample_local_testing_tool.py $TEST_CASE -- python3 sample_interactive_script.py
done
```

You need to flush after printing `print(i, flush=True)`







## Directions

```
    d = {}
    d["N"] = (1,0)
    d["S"] = (-1,0)
    d["E"] = (0,1)
    d["W"] = (0,-1)
    
    if coords[0] > 0:
        res += "N"*coords[0]
    else:
        res += "S"*abs(coords[0])

    if coords[1] > 0:
        res += "E"*coords[0]
    else:
        res += "W"*abs(coords[0])
```
