# I got zero for this :(
Question 1 I could not find out my errors. Question 2 the code took too long to run (it generates 1GB of memory) and my answers is wrong also.

# Reflections
I should not be using Python for any coding challenge. It is too slow.

Moreover, if I am using Python, I need to have a standard process to read and write files. I spent quite some time hand-copying test cases to the notebook input space.

Multiprocessing. On my computer I could only run 37 cases for question 2. I can select a 24 or 96 vCPU cloud and run the cases in parallel. It works (though my code produce the wrong result). Following is the installation script for your cloud:
```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonghuikang/kickstart/master/install.sh | sudo bash```

Now I will analyse why my answers are wrong :/

# Question Analysis
For Question 1, I have missed the special case of zeros. What I did is to multiply two numbers count how many numbers are equal to the result. To make the code run slightly faster I first sort them and the see if any of the larger number is the product of the first two numbers. However, the triplet of `(0,0,100)` for example works as `0*100=0` but it isn't included in our system. I then moved on to the next question. To solve the large problem, you need to use hash tables and collections - i.e. grouping the numbers with the same value together. Libraries like `collections` and `deque` seem to be essential before you can claim that you work with Python.

I could not find out where I am wrong in Question 2. (Probably everything) The code provided by Python writer xjcl does not work: https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/5374486/scoreboard?c=5374486#vf=1&sp=331 This person also seem to follow a standard debugging procedure, separating print to file and printing on console. I hope to learn more.

# Google Kickstart 2018 Round G

### Why Python? (I retract this - ALWAYS USE .CPP FOR CODEJAM/KICKSTART)
Because I have been coding in Python. The intermediate results are saved and be easily be shown to other people. Moreover I am not yet in the business of optimising yet. I am not sure for Google Kickstart/CodeJam but I know that Hackerrank allow more run time for files written in Python.

The use of Python was an issue in a recent coding challenge at Credit Suisse. Python was slow, which is suspect is due to all the deepcopy that needs to be made. Someday, I need to have some understanding of C++ does. 


# On the use of code from the Internet

From https://code.google.com/codejam/resources/faq:

> During the round, can I use code written before the round?
> As long as you have a license to use it, yes. That means you can write your own helper code, or collect your own personal library of code, as long as the license terms of the code permit it. Some Code Jam contestants will have competed on an ACM ICPC team, and many of those teams have their own code books; check with your team's coach whether it's permissible for you to use that code in a different context.

I guess I will simply use what I can find on the Internet for this competition. I should be expected to write from functions like sort algorithms from scratch.

Sometimes the code from the Internet is faulty as well. "ABB" and "BAB" are anagrams of each other, but https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other/ detects otherwise.
